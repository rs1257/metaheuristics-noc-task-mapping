Metaheuristics NoC Task Mapping
===============================

Implemented Metaheuristics for the Task Mapping problem over Real-Time Networks-on-Chip. I have implemented the metaheuristics Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm optimisation, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search and Ant Colony Optimisation. As well as Random Mapping to compare how these metaheuristics perform.
